A Node.JS bot to pull data from The Blue Alliance. The hookVersion file is setup to work with hook.io, a 'microservice as a service' vendor.

Currently the bot supports pulling status information about what event a team is at, team record in a given year, team events for a given year, team awards in a given year, and collected team info including social media.
